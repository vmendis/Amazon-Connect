Create Contact Flows

We are going to build two new contact flows (EmployeeBooking_TransferToQueue & EmployeBooking_MainFlow) 
and use one default contact flow (Default Customer Queue) to build the scenario as per below.

When a caller calls the contact center, EmployeeBooking_Mainflow will play welcome message and 
sets the working queue. Further it will check hours of operations, set the call recording 
behaviour for both agent and customer and plays the wait treatment music.

Contact Flows:
  1.  EmployeeBooking_TransferToQueue. 
      See Call Flow-1.png.
      Code is in ./Code/EmployeeBooking_TransferToQueue

  2. Default Customer Queue is used as the wait treatment by our two queues. 

  3. EmployeeBooking_MainFlow - In this module, our main flow will stay simple, giving a welcome message
     and transferring to our EmployeeBooking_TransferToQueue flow, which we created earlier.

     Before the welcome message, we want to give a ‘chime’, which will be uploaded as a static announcement (prompt).

     a. create a prompt
        Routing>Prompts
        Prompt name : WelcomeChime
        Use the Welcome Chime from ./Code or from 
        here https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/cf45bce8-f0a0-4c0d-83e6-ae510931c091/en-US/module1/contactflows/contanctflowmainflow 
        as the recording.
