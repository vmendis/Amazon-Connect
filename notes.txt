Define Hours of Operation

Populate Hours of operation of our company.
Routing > Hours of operation
      Add new hours
      Set Name as "EmployeeBooking_DefaultHours"


Create two Queues

Routing > Queues
1st queue name to be "EmployeeBooking_Authenticated"
2nd queue name to be "EmployeeBooking_Unknown"


Create a Routing Profile
Users > Routing Profiles

Name the routing profile as "EmployeeBooking_Default

User Creation

We are creating an Agent who will answer the telephone calls.

Users > User Management 

Create Contact Flows

We are going to build two new contact flows (EmployeeBooking_TransferToQueue & EmployeBooking_MainFlow) 
and use one default contact flow (Default Customer Queue) to build the scenario as per below.

When a caller calls the contact center, EmployeeBooking_Mainflow will play welcome message and 
sets the working queue. Further it will check hours of operations, set the call recording 
behaviour for both agent and customer and plays the wait treatment music.

Contact Flows:

  0.  EmployeeBooking_AgentWhisper
      See  https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/cf45bce8-f0a0-4c0d-83e6-ae510931c091/en-US/module3/whisperflow
      Code is in : ./Code/EmployeeBooking_AgentWhisper


  1.  EmployeeBooking_TransferToQueue. 
      See Call Flow-1.png.
      Code is in ./Code/EmployeeBooking_TransferToQueue

  2. Default Customer Queue is used as the wait treatment by our two queues. 

  3. EmployeeBooking_MainFlow - In this module, our main flow will stay simple, giving a welcome message
     and transferring to our EmployeeBooking_TransferToQueue flow, which we created earlier.
     Code is in ./Code/EmployeeBooking_MainFlow

     Before the welcome message, we want to give a ‘chime’, which will be uploaded as a static announcement (prompt).

     a. create a prompt
        Routing>Prompts
        Prompt name : WelcomeChime
        Use the Welcome Chime from ./Code or from 
        here https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/cf45bce8-f0a0-4c0d-83e6-ae510931c091/en-US/module1/contactflows/contanctflowmainflow 
        as the recording.

     b. Connect main Contact Flow to our Phone Number
        Chanells --> Phone Numbers

   4. Add notes about testing the call flow
      You should be able to hear the Welcome Chime, Welcome Message, Queue Message, and music while waiting in the queue


Amazon Connect and Amazon Lex - Skipping this as of 5.Aug.2022. Do this step later on.


Creating Lambda

Improve the contact flow created in the previous module by designing an Amazon Connect dynamic flow, allow employee
authentication, and greet and transfer authenticated employees to designated queue. We will use AWS Lambda and
Amazon DynamoDB for the purpose.

Follow steps in https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/cf45bce8-f0a0-4c0d-83e6-ae510931c091/en-US/module3

"Setup Greeting (Whisperflow)" is already is in our code. So skip this step.


Whisper message I heard : EmployeeBooking Unknown



------------
EmployeeBooking_Authentication contact flow

Modify "Invoke AWS Lambda function"
    Update the ARN field with your own Lambda ARN


Understanding the contact flow:

   1. The Lambda function can either be a success, or it can return an error.
   If the Lambda function fails, we are going to set a Contact Attribute, which can be used later in the flow, displayed in agent
   application or stored in Contact Trace Records. In this case, we want to track what happened with the authentication process, hence 
   setting EmployeeLookup=PhoneNumber-Failed (which means that we tried to find the employee by phone number, but there was an error)


   2. If Lambda was successful, we have to check the result returned by Lambda. In our case, we want the attribute External > EmployeeType. Expecting results:

    Unknown phone number (EmployeeType = 0) or
    Existing Phone Number,

   but the employee has to enter EmployeePIN (EmployeeType = 2).

   If we get anything else (EmployeeType not 0 nor 2), we are taking the fail path from point number 1.

   3. If our Lambda function returns Unknown, we are going to set the Contact Attribute, and move to the next step in our scenario – ask
      the customer for their EmployeeID (see point number 24).

   4. If our Lambda function returns “2” – Ask for PIN, we are going to play the Welcome message first, greeting the employee by their name.
