Define Hours of Operation

Populate Hours of operation of our company.
Routing > Hours of operation
      Add new hours
      Set Name as "EmployeeBooking_DefaultHours"


Create two Queues

Routing > Queues
1st queue name to be "EmployeeBooking_Authenticated"
2nd queue name to be "EmployeeBooking_Unknown"


Create a Routing Profile
Users > Routing Profiles

Name the routing profile as "EmployeeBooking_Default

User Creation

We are creating an Agent who will answer the telephone calls.

Users > User Management 

Create Contact Flows

We are going to build two new contact flows (EmployeeBooking_TransferToQueue & EmployeBooking_MainFlow) 
and use one default contact flow (Default Customer Queue) to build the scenario as per below.

When a caller calls the contact center, EmployeeBooking_Mainflow will play welcome message and 
sets the working queue. Further it will check hours of operations, set the call recording 
behaviour for both agent and customer and plays the wait treatment music.

Contact Flows:

  0.  EmployeeBooking_AgentWhisper
      See  https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/cf45bce8-f0a0-4c0d-83e6-ae510931c091/en-US/module3/whisperflow
      Code is in : ./Code/EmployeeBooking_AgentWhisper


  1.  EmployeeBooking_TransferToQueue. 
      See Call Flow-1.png.
      Code is in ./Code/EmployeeBooking_TransferToQueue

  2. Default Customer Queue is used as the wait treatment by our two queues. 

  3. EmployeeBooking_MainFlow - In this module, our main flow will stay simple, giving a welcome message
     and transferring to our EmployeeBooking_TransferToQueue flow, which we created earlier.
     Code is in ./Code/EmployeeBooking_MainFlow

     Before the welcome message, we want to give a ‘chime’, which will be uploaded as a static announcement (prompt).

     a. create a prompt
        Routing>Prompts
        Prompt name : WelcomeChime
        Use the Welcome Chime from ./Code or from 
        here https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/cf45bce8-f0a0-4c0d-83e6-ae510931c091/en-US/module1/contactflows/contanctflowmainflow 
        as the recording.

     b. Connect main Contact Flow to our Phone Number
        Chanells --> Phone Numbers

   4. Add notes about testing the call flow
      You should be able to hear the Welcome Chime, Welcome Message, Queue Message, and music while waiting in the queue


Amazon Connect and Amazon Lex - Skipping this as of 5.Aug.2022. Do this step later on.


Creating Lambda

Improve the contact flow created in the previous module by designing an Amazon Connect dynamic flow, allow employee
authentication, and greet and transfer authenticated employees to designated queue. We will use AWS Lambda and
Amazon DynamoDB for the purpose.

Follow steps in https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/cf45bce8-f0a0-4c0d-83e6-ae510931c091/en-US/module3

"Setup Greeting (Whisperflow)" is already is in our code. So skip this step.


Whisper message I heard : EmployeeBooking Unknown
