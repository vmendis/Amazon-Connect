We are going to build two new contact flows (EmployeeBooking_TransferQueue & EmployeBooking_MainFlow) 
and use one default contact flow (Default Customer Queue) to build the scenario as per below.

When a caller calls the contact center, EmployeeBooking_Mainflow will play welcome message and 
sets the working queue. Further it will check hours of operations, set the call recording 
behaviour for both agent and customer and plays the wait treatment music.
