ReturnResult.EmployeeType = 0; //Unknown Employee
ReturnResult.EmployeeType = 1; //Authenticated
ReturnResult.EmployeeType = 2; //Ask for PIN
ReturnResult.EmployeeType = 3; //PIN is wrong


NOTE: The responses from the Lambda testing is given here with the test name for clarity.

1. First test event is going to cover the “Unknown” phone number scenario:

Test Event Name
Unknown

Response
{
  "EmployeeType": 0,
  "EmployeeName": "Unknown",
  "EmployeePIN": null
}

2. Second test is with a PhoneNumber for an existing employee.

Test Event Name
Known

Response
{
  "EmployeeID": "101",
  "EmployeeName": "Virantha",
  "EmployeePIN": null,
  "EmployeeType": 2
}


3. Third event, we are going to send EmployeePIN with a PhoneNumber for an existing employee,
so that we can complete the process of authentication.

Test Event Name
Emp_ID_and_Emp_PIN

Response
{
  "EmployeeID": "101",
  "EmployeeName": "Virantha",
  "EmployeePIN": null,
  "EmployeeType": 1
}

4. In this event, we are going to send EmployeeID and EmployeePIN (to cover the scenario when
an employee is calling from an unknown phone number)

Test Event Name
Emp_ID_and_Emp_PIN

Response
{
  "EmployeeID": "101",
  "EmployeeName": "Virantha",
  "EmployeePIN": null,
  "EmployeeType": 1
}

5. The final event is going to send EmployeeID, but wrong EmployeePIN

EmpID_Wrong_EmpPin

Response
{
  "EmployeeID": "101",
  "EmployeeName": "Virantha",
  "EmployeePIN": null,
  "EmployeeType": 3
}



Testing

1. Known phone number --> Asks for PIN -- > Enter PIN --> "Employee have successfully authenticated. Not calling Lex Bot, terminating the call"

2. Known phone number --> Asks for PIN -- > Enter WRONG PIN --> "Sorry Pin invalid"  --> "Press 1 for an Agent"
